"We are very impressed with Comm100 Live Chat. Having tried [live support](http://www.comm100.com/livesupport/ "Live Support Software") type products for our business in the past, they never seemed to really benefit our business. However, Comm100 Live Chat has definitely increased sales and we tend to think that our website before we use this live chat software was like having a shop with no staff; we can now help customers at any point during their visit to our website and track their progress. This is also very professional and just works and is easy for all our staff to use. Comm100 Live Chat has become vital to our business.
